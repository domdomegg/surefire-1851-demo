# surefire-1851-demo

Minimal repository to demonstrate bug [SUREFIRE-1851](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-1851)

Simply clone and run `mvn test`. You can also see the result of this in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/domdomegg/surefire-1851-demo/actions).

`ExampleTest.aFailingTest()` *should* fail, which *should* cause the `mvn test` command to fail. However, due to a bug (tracked by SUREFIRE-1851) this failing test breaks the runner, and maven reports that all tests were successful ðŸ˜¬
